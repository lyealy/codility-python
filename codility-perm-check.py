# 1. PermCheck
#
# A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
# A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
# For example, array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2
# is a permutation, but array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
# is not a permutation.
# The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
# Write a function:
# def solution(A)
# that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
# For example, given array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
#     A[3] = 2
# the function should return 1.
# Given array A such that:
#     A[0] = 4
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 3
# the function should return 0.
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
# Complexity:
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

def solution(A):
    present = [False] * len(A)
    for a in A:
        if a > len(present):
            return 0
        present[a - 1] = True
    for is_valid in present:
        if not is_valid:
            return 0
    return 1
